                <h2>Josef’s Journey</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>Born in 1914, Switzerland. During his earlier years, Josef started as an apprentice although due to the big boss not being around much, he quit after his second year. Despite knowing very little about typography or illustration he was determined to broaden his horizons...leading him to be taught by “two masters”, Ern and Alfred.</li>
                    <li>Josef became fascinated from the common habit his ‘masters’ had done. Ern and Alfred would take certain posters and designs from the streets and correct issues found in them - inspiring Josef to design posters.</li>
                    <img class="port-img" src="port.png" alt=""/>
                    <li>After decades of admiring lectures naming them “wonderful human beings”, he was convinced he was the best Swiss graphic designer.</li>
                    <li>Humbling himself soon after studying his masters, Josef was not able to grasp the concept of quality in his work leading him to teach himself the core principles of design; layout, composition, form giving.</li>
                    <li>Comparing his work to another artist, Josef gave up on drawing and moved onto typography and photography. Developing new skills everyday - an admiration influenced him, his ultimate goal was to become as well-rounded as possible. Learning architecture, city planning, writing, sculpture, painting, product design, gardening, typography...everything! Being interested and gaining good contacts was only going to benefit in a brighter future.</li>

                <h2>What really matters in Josef’s reality?</h2>
                <p>Ironically, perfect spacing and how a font tilts slightly left to right is what keeps Josef up at night. Josef undoubtedly cared about detail, that’s what made him a marvellous artist. If typography is on long and short lines - what does that mean? According to Josef, the longer the line, the more energy it takes to read. In contrast, if the line is too short a reader can lose energy.</p>

                       <H3>“its a questions of communication, if typography is from a high functional point of view, you can memorise the text much better and the content of text, its psychological point of view and a aesthetic point of view because a well done typography is an aesthetic too but first it must be functional.” --Josef </H3>
