                <h2>Josef’s Journey</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>Born in 1914, Switzerland. During his earlier years, Josef started as an apprentice although due to the big boss not being around much, he quit after his second year. Despite knowing very little about typography or illustration he was determined to broaden his horizons...leading him to be taught by “two masters”, Ern and Alfred.</li>
                    <li>Josef became fascinated from the common habit his ‘masters’ had done. Ern and Alfred would take certain posters and designs from the streets and correct issues found in them - inspiring Josef to design posters.</li>

                    <li>After decades of admiring lectures naming them “wonderful human beings”, he was convinced he was the best Swiss graphic designer.</li>
                    <li>Humbling himself soon after studying his masters, Josef was not able to grasp the concept of quality in his work leading him to teach himself the core principles of design; layout, composition, form giving.</li>
                    <li>Comparing his work to another artist, Josef gave up on drawing and moved onto typography and photography. Developing new skills everyday - an admiration influenced him, his ultimate goal was to become as well-rounded as possible. Learning architecture, city planning, writing, sculpture, painting, product design, gardening, typography...everything! Being interested and gaining good contacts was only going to benefit in a brighter future.</li>

                <p class="quote-text">“stay self critical, don't be satisfied with what you have done, don't accept an applause from outside, be your own self critical instance” - Josef Muller Brockmann</p>

                <h2>What really matters in Josef’s reality?</h2>
                <p>Ironically, perfect spacing and how a font tilts slightly left to right is what keeps Josef up at night. Josef undoubtedly cared about detail, that’s what made him a marvellous artist.
                <p>If typography is on long and short lines - what does that mean? Well...the longer the line, the more energy it takes to read. In contrast, if the line is too short a reader can lose energy. If anyone wants to be a good designer, they must learn to be the ultimate communicator of informative design. The best way to do that is through typography.</p>
                <p>Psychology is the basis of all design, how typography is displayed, what colour it is, how thick or thin, if it has a light point or curve at the edges of each type...it all matters. Josef was a huge believer that “typography has the function to inform clearly and rapidly”. His most loved fonts had to be “aimless good formed alphabets” such as: Clarendon, Times, Baskerville, Alberts (by Berthold), Helvetica and Antiqua.</p>
                <p>Always striving to be more, Josef wanted to be useful to society - maintaining a clear goal throughout his entire career and lifetime. A story that he mentioned in an Interview with Roger Remington in 1987 declared that Josef ‘made publicity, exhibitions and advertisments for companies that he worked with. One day, whilst reading in the newspaper he seen that smoking was dangerous and caused cancer. Immedienty afterwards, he rang his clients and cut ties as he did not want to promote propaganda for a dangerous product as they created “bad formed products” that did not align with his morals.</p>
                <p>After this incident, Josef reflected on a memory of his which was in relation to creating artwork for a political election propoganda, realising that he had also met people that were “very ambitious and egotistic and secondly social minded...they fought for their own profit then from the profit of society”.</p>
